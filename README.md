### disclaimer
I am not an authority and I hold no legal power over anyone, plus I do not participate in any type of groups. The reason why I am saying this gibberish is that people somehow thinks I am an officer or some sort of powerful guy or organization tracking down people, no, it is not this and I am a person, not an organization. Let alone the fact I use my tools with moderation and I must require a reason for an action. If you receive any notifications of someone claiming to be me, do not interact any further with them, first, send me a screenshot of this supposed me in my discord server (https://discord.gg/cnHBp4PGet), my username "lij4". Or you can simply just write "lij4" in discord's "add friends" option, then hit "send friend request".

I had to delete and make new accounts due to organization and renovation, since my previous accounts were absolute anarchy. Do not mind the recent registration, this is just the new me üòÉ. All accounts related to me are new accounts for now plus all profiles you find in social media are also recent, if you find any profile with my name in it, make sure to tell me in my discord DMs or server before interacting with it. I say that because some impersonators are trying to cause prejudice to my reputation.
