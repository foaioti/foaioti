### dedicated areas
1. **💻 Digital Forensics.**
   - Not available for business nor for any type of commissioned work, but I can talk about topics related to digital investigation.
2. **🧐 Argument/discussion analysis.**
   - Finding discrepancies and flaws in statements are essential because by understanding what is being talked and written & how is being talked and written will open space for better perspectives and interpretations about what we are absorbing, by voice or text.
3. **📖 Writing.**
   - World building and general knowledge about writing stories, mainly sci-fi + fantasy.
