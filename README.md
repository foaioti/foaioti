### dedicated areas
1. **üíª Digital Forensics.**
   - Not available for business nor for any type of commissioned work, but I can talk about topics related to digital investigation.
   - You can freely report someone to me in my discord server. I will sportively investigate a target (or targets) for fun and even take actions against them if there is any necessity or possibility for such action, you can be notified about new discoveries if you wish.
   >I will receive all reports, specially reports related to scam, death threats, cyber terrorism, ideological groups, problematic person.
2. **üßê Argument/discussion analysis.**
   - Finding discrepancies and flaws in statements are essential because by understanding what is being talked and written & how is being talked and written will open space for better perspectives and interpretations about what we are absorbing, by voice or text.
3. **üìñ Writing.**
   - World building and general knowledge about writing stories, mainly sci-fi + fantasy. Writing is a good way to spend time when you have nothing to do, it stimulates the brain and strenghtens your vocabulary over time.

### disclaimer
I am not an authority and I hold no legal power over anyone, plus I do not participate in any type of groups. The reason why I am saying this gibberish is that people somehow thinks I am an officer or some sort of powerful guy or organization tracking down people, no, it is not this and I am a person, not an organization. Let alone the fact I use my tools with moderation and I must require a reason for an action. If you receive any notifications of someone claiming to be me, do not interact any further with them, first, send me a screenshot of this supposed me in my discord server (https://discord.gg/cnHBp4PGet), my username "lij4". Or you can simply just write "lij4" in discord's "add friends" option, then hit "send friend request".
